# ng-Reddit

This is a Reddit-type app I created using AngularJS and Firebase. It isn't exactly a Rediit clone, but has all the basic features. I was just trying to focus on adding the functionality, so not very concerned with how it looks. 

## Features Added

- Users log in and out via twitter
- Only logged in users can submit new posts and comment
- CRUD posts
- CRD comments
- Only logged in users can vote
- Restrict amount of voting per user
