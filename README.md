# ng-Reddit

This is a Reddit clone I created using AngularJS and Firebase. 

As I was trying to focus only on the functinoality, I used bootstrap to help with the front-end design. I am not so great with bootsrap so it doesn't look amazing but things work.


## To Do

A few things I am still working on -

- ~~Restrict access to areas for not logged in users~~
- ~~Only users who create the post can edit and delete~~
- Upvote / Downvote functionality: make it so that users can only upvote or downvote once on a given post, and can't vote on their own post
- Comments: ability to edit/delete comments
- Users can only submit either URL or comment, but not both
- Sign in with other methods other than twitters
